(GUI/Command line Interface/Library/Module/API/Classes)

———————
Avoid gratuitous incompatibilities with the surrounding environment

Principle of least astonishment

———————
Document interfaces before implementing them

Employ progressive disclosure

Introduce new types to prevent common errors.

Consider explicitly defining all possible values for the type.

Avoid overreliance on string.
